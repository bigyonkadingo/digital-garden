After a heartbreaking 2017 Western Conference Finals injury and subsequent exit with the San Antonio Spurs, Kawhi Leonard's future as a Spur quickly became unstable. His injury kept him out of the following 2017-2018 season, compounded further by arising issues between the team and Kawhi, who was unhappy with how the team handled his quad injury. It became very apparent that Leonard wanted out of San Antonio.

The question then became: Where to go? 2016 saw him leading the Spurs with 25.5 points per game, his third best season to date. When healthy, Kawhi was an elite 2-way defender, considered by many to be the best in the league at the time. But within that statement is a large stipulation: "When healthy." It had become more and more apparent that Kawhi's health would be a large factor in his promise as a star player, which was only highlighted more as he requested a trade during a season he only committed nine starts within. Any team taking him would be taking a large risk, as even with injury doubts he would still require a large investment for a trade to go through.

It had been fairly consistently reported that the Spurs and Raptors had been in trade talks over Kawhi for a long time, and it felt like it was only a matter of time until something was decided. In the end, the Spurs gave up Kawhi and Danny Green in exchange for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 first-round pick. Toronto went into the trade knowing that keeping Kawhi past the upcoming 2018-2019 season was unlikely [https://www.nba.com/news/report-san-antonio-spurs-toronto-raptors-engaged-serious-talks-kawhi-leonard|1(NBA)]
